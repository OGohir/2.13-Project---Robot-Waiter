 * This program calculates the total bill for a group dining at a buffet restaurant.
 * It considers the number of adults, children, and babies in the group,
 * adds drink charges, calculates tips, taxes, and outputs the total bill.
 * The tip is optional for groups under 10 people but mandatory (20%) for larger groups.
 * Users can choose to tip in dollars or as a percentage.
 * The final bill includes tax.
